She had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart. She must have been 6 years old, 
this beautiful brown haired, freckle-faced image of innocence. It was pouring outside. 
The kind of rain that gushes over the top of rain gutters, 
so much in a hurry to hit the Earth, it has no time to flow down the spout.
We all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart. 
We all waited, some patiently, others irritated, because nature messed up their hurried day.
 I am always mesmerized by rainfall. I get lost in the sound and sight of 
the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of running, 
splashing so carefree as a child come pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day.
Her voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all caught in, "Mom, let's run through the rain." she said.
